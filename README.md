This bachelor thesis explores the development of a smart route planner to enhance time efficiency in home care services, in collaboration with Tietoevry and Gjøvik Municipality. The goal was to reduce inactive time between service recipients and optimize the number of required home care providers, thereby increasing the time available for direct patient care. 

The research was based on data collected through user interviews with representatives from Gjøvik Municipality, as well as compatibility analyses with Tietoevry's Gerica service. To address the identified issue, a promising system architecture was explored. It was based on a base module with a cost-saving algorithmic approach which produced an initial solution, and an iterative module that gradually tried to improve this initial solution. Two proposals for the iterative module were considered: one based on a genetic algorithm and another on machine learning.

The results indicated that the machine learning method outperformed the genetic algorithm by quickly recognizing optimization opportunity patterns in the solution proposal from the base module. The system architecture also proved effective in returning good solutions rapidly with an improving effect over time. This method allowed for adaptation both for situations that required a quick response and for longer-term planning.
